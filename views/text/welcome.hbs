Hello!

Hi {{name}}! welcome to Choirless, the platform that lets people sing/dance/perform wherever they are!

Now that you have an account, getting started is super easy.

To start your choir, you can go straight to your dashboard at https://choirless.com/dashboard and create your choir in less than 3 clicks!

Once youâ€™ve done that, you can invite members to join your choir, record song parts and  render the entire performance in no time at all!
